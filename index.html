              Why is vaccination important?
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                Vaccination helps to prevent diseases and save lives. When we get vaccinated, we arenâ€™t just protecting ourselves, but also those around us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination continues to be critically important. Therfore we ensure that essential immunization and health services continue, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.

               Does the Covid-19 vaccine provide long term protection?
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                It is too early to know the duration of protection of the Covid-19 vaccine since this vaccine has been recently developed. Although the available data suggests that most people who recover from COVID-19 develop an immune response that provides at least some period of protection against reinfection.

                 Will other vaccines help protect me from Covid-19?
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                Currently, there is no evidence that any other vaccines, apart from those specifically designed for the SARS-Cov-2 virus,  will protect against COVID-19.

                What are the benefits of getting vaccinated?
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                The COVID-19 vaccines produce protection against the disease, as a result of developing an immune response to the SARS-Cov-2 virus.  Developing immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk of developing the  illness and its consequences. This immunity helps you fight the virus if exposed. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, because if you are protected from getting infected and from disease, you are less likely to infect someone else.

                How safe and effective is the vaccine?
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                This vaccine is considered safe; due to the effective passage of the vaccine testing stages, its strong immune response and persistent antibodies. The side effects of the vaccine are mostly minor and temporary(injection site reaction, mild fever, or headache).

                After you've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces until we know more.
